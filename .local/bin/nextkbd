## THIS IS NOT THE GREATEST IMPLEMENTATION
# each time this script runs, it adds a new xcape process
# it also adds the options to the option list, making them duplicate (but doesn't seem to have
# negative effects)

# SOLUTION ON awesomeWM:
# - have xcape be one of the run_once startup apps
# - set the layouts and options using `localectl` as follows:
#       `localectl --no-convert set-x11-keymap gb,us "" "" ctrl:nocaps,shift:both_capslock`
# - change the keyboard shortcut to use awesome's builtin nextkbd function instead of this script.
